			Wooki makes an extensive use of new browser technologies, and this won't stop i.e. to handle real-time concurrent
    		document edition or off-line storage.
    		Since using Wooki with Internet Explorer is not representative of its design and objectives, 
    		we have decided to decline all the requests coming from this browser.
		</p>
		<p>
    		Anyway, Wooki has been developed and tested with Firefox, Safari and Chrome. Give it a try !
